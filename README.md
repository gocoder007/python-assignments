# Python Assignments

This repository contains two Python scripts submitted as part of my assignment.

**Task 1 – Perform Basic Mathematical Operations:**  
This program takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It helps in understanding Python’s arithmetic operators and user input handling.

**Task 2 – Create a Personalized Greeting:**  
This program asks the user for their name and then displays a personalized greeting message. It demonstrates the use of input functions, string concatenation, and formatted output in Python.

Thank-you
